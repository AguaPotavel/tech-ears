# üßë‚Äçüíª Contributing

Thank you so much for contributing for this project! Here are some guidelness:

### Git workflow basic

1. Create an issue and describe features you want -> [here](https://github.com/arthcc/tech-ears/issues)
2. Fork this project -> [here](https://github.com/arthcc/tech-ears/fork)
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some features'`)
5. Publish the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request -> [here](https://github.com/arthcc/tech-ears/compare)

# ‚ùó Some Rules:

1. All Issues MUST be in English
2. See if the feature you want is already at the Issues Tab
3. All PRs must best tested, and I'll check it out before merging.
4. Use the Git Conventional Commits (WTF is That?) [Check it Out Here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification)
